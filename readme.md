Instructions:

Place students into teams of 3-4 and challenge them 
to guess the output of the following files.

Display the code for each file (and make sure your
text editor isnt highlighting syntax errors!
In VSCode I included the pylinting disabled
option in the .vscode folder for this repo).

Give them a minute or two to guess what the output will be
and write it down. 

Run the code and award a point to each correct team.

In most cases, then you should correct the code to demonstrate
what the working version would look like.

Be sure not to save the updated version, or re-clone the repo
to the broken version before starting this activity again.
