# I include this one because a lot of tutorials out there
# will use python2 and print is a big difference.
# This should make students aware of the potential for problems
# and always to use python3 tutorials/snippets when available.
# in python2 print works without parentheses.
# python3 recognizes that print is a function and therefore should have parens
